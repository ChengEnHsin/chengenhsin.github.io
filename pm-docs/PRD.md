Project title
The Universal Language - Dance

One-sentence goal of the website
I want to have a page where users can interact with the website and learn about different types of dance styles around the world.

3–5 core features (written as bullet points or user stories)
1. when users click on different types of dance styles' names, it will direct them to a youtube link where it can showcase an example of the dance style alongside a description of words describing the style
2. have a button that says "fun facts about dance" and have different messages pop up everytime when cilcked about any fun facts within the dance community or any dance heritage.
3. have a section where it could ask you to locate your location and it will search up nearby dance studios on Google for you to look into


List of 4–6 intended pages (e.g., homepage, about, gallery, contact)

Homepage
Gallery of dance photos
About page for each style
Locating page
Fun facts page


Optional: brief notes on design/interaction (e.g., dark mode toggle)
ideally something with the color schemes of black, white and dark red, simplistic and universal designs
